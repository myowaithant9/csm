                      <p>As a design style in recent
                        years, there are many patterns such as controlling the view on the client side and returning JSON on the server side .
                        With such a design, the server side functions are routine processing such as authentication, data storage and reading.
                        In mobile, in particular, push notifications, geolocation interlocking, social collaboration etc are often mentioned as important and necessary functions, but it is hard to develop each time.
                        It is BaaS that prepares and provides such routine processing in advance, and realizes its platform.
